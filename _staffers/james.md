bio: Hi y'all! I'm a recent Berkeley graduate from Virginia. At Cal, I majored in Computer Science and Data Science with a minor in Public Policy, and in the fall I'll be attending Virginia Tech to pursue an MS in Computer Science. I love cooking, reading, watching soccer, and coffee. This is my second time teaching Data 6 and I am so excited to be returning to this amazing class this summer! I hope you enjoy learning data science as much as I do :)
